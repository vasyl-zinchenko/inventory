<p>🏆 And also a new personal achievement</p>

<p>There are still some things in this app that could be improved 🛠️. But the main functionality works and that's good 👍</p>
Here you can create an order, as well as products for it. To demonstrate, I created the data and some categories with a corresponding image.
